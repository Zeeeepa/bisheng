# Aerospace Science Website Design Scheme

## 1. Overall Structure & Page Layout
- **Homepage**: Brief introduction, navigation, featured content highlights (latest news, recommended articles, image/video carousel).
- **Basic Knowledge Section**: Aerospace science principles, terminology, key concepts, with links to authoritative resources.
- **Historical Events Section**: Timeline of major aerospace milestones (e.g., China's manned space program, Apollo missions), each event with date, summary, and source.
- **Cutting-edge Technologies Section**: Latest aerospace innovations (e.g., X-59 Quesst, AAM, Roman Telescope), each with principle, application, and source.
- **Interactive Section**: Q&A, quizzes, DIY experiments, 3D visualization tools, discussion board.
- **Image/Video Gallery**: High-quality images and videos (NASA, CNSA, ESA), categorized by theme (spacewalks, planets, missions, Earth observation).
- **Footer**: Contact info, copyright, external links (NASA, SpaceX, CNSA, ESA), social media icons.

## 2. Navigation & Layout
- **Top Navigation Bar**: Fixed, includes logo (space-themed), links to all main sections, search bar (right-aligned), language switch (if needed).
- **Sidebar (optional for desktop)**: Quick links to popular topics, featured images/videos, recent Q&A.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly, collapsible menu, image grid adapts to screen size.

## 3. Color Scheme & Visual Style
- **Primary Colors**: Technology Blue (#1A237E), Starfield Black (#121212), Accent White (#F5F5F5), Highlight Silver (#B0BEC5).
- **Button Style**: Rounded corners, gradient blue/black, hover effect (glow or shadow).
- **Font**: Sans-serif (Roboto, Arial), large headings, clear body text, consistent spacing.
